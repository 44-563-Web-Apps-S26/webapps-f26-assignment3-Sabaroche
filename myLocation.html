    My favorite place to visit is Emerald Pool, Dominica. It is an area within
    the Morne Trois Pitons National Park. It features a 40ft cascade with crystal
    clear water. It is a chilly yet quite refreshing swim. That, plus the lush
    green vegetation in the area, makes it quite a relaxing and enjoyable place
    to be.
